AHGraR creates interactive graph visualizations from custom-built homology databases.
The gene-centric representation includes the option to display the local gene neighborhood. This helps the user to 
distinguish orthologs and
paralogs by local synteny . The software supports genome sequences in FASTA format and GFF3 formatted
annotation files. The process of building the homology databases requires only a minimum amount of user
interaction. 
Most modules of AHGraR are written in Python 3.5. The webinterface
extends KnetMaps.js and is based on JavaScript. Additional third-party tools include MCL, BLAST+ and
Neo4j.
